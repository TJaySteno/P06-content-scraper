## Project 6
### Build a Content Scraper

This sixth project was my first Node.js project for my Tech Degree. Using Node.js and different packages found through npm, this app will scrape information off of a mock website built for this course (http://shirts4mike.com/shirts.php). Using an npm content scraper (Cheerio), I will grab and sort the vital information. This will then be stored in a CSV file using another npm package (papaparse). I've chosen these two packages due to their widespread use and the recency of their last updates.

*__Skills:__ Node.js, npm*

__Grade:__ Exceeds Expectations

__Grader's Overall Comments:__ "You have accomplished your 6th project with some extremely good code. I enjoyed reading through it check out any methods I can utilize in my own projects. Your error handling is well done. I think you were very thorough in making sure anything that went wrong would be handled. This kind of working is something you're gonna need in your later projects, just keep doing what you're doing!

"Happy coding!"
