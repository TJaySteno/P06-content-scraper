## Project 6
### Content Scraper

This will be my first Node.js project of my Tech Degree. Using Node.js and npm packages, I will retrieve information from a mock website built for this course (http://shirts4mike.com/shirts.php). Using an npm content scraper (Cheerio), I will grab and sort the vital information. This will then be stored in a CSV file using another npm package (papaparse). I've chosen these two packages due to their widespread use and the recency of their last publish dates.
